DeclarePanel
=============

Sometimes you just need to look at the implementation of the symbol and have to go to it.
At the same time, we lose the context in which we were and if there were a lot of transitions,
then it would be difficult to return to the initial place. DeclarePanel helps solve this problem.
You can open the symbol implementation in the bottom panel without going to it.

Default settings:
By default, we try to search through anaconda (can be disabled in the settings).
We are looking for a second time through the standard Sublime Text mechanism.
It always displays the first result.
Be careful the first result may not be relevant.

Usage
-----

In Sublime Text from the context menu 'Paste as. . . ' or hotkeys <kbd>Shift + Alt + v</kbd>
Position on the desired character and hit <kbd>Alt + s</kbd>
For toggle panel <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + s</kbd>
